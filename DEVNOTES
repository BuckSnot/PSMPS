	DEV NOTES

	In short, I will optimize tasks so the version will be split to have an update
	later for unimportant scripts. :) The most efficient route to release :D

	Last Update:		0011 EST (GMT-0500)
	Updated Release Time:	Tomorrow (its 2355) 0800 - 1400 EST (GMT-0500)

	NOTE: Working all night. May not update dev notes as much. 
	      I will be working on this until 1400 tomorrow.

- psmps-install-wallet (one last thing... attempt adding coindaemon (wallet server) to auto get the path to itself. If cant it will ask. Very quick to do :D)

- psmps-install-mpos (Installs MPOS - EAsY)
- psmps-install-scripts (install links to every script in sbin - EAsY)

- psmps-repair-permissions (Resets Ownership/Permissions - EAsY)
- psmps-repair-crontab (checks/adds coinname to crontab - EAsY)
- psmps-repair-startup (checks/adds coinname to startup script - EAsY)
- psmps-repair-configs (repairs symbolic links to csf config, coin configs,stratum configs, and MPOS configs in each coin dir - SUPER EASY :D)
