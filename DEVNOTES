	NOTE: Just have a few small tasks to do then release !!!

FOR v1.01 THE FOLLOWING IS LEFT TO DO

- Full testing (front-back install) on my 'virgin' server
- Add to startup (easy - one command within a script)

FOR the v1.2 INSTALL and v1.01 - v1.2 UPDATE THE FOLLOWING IS LEFT TO DO

- FULL auto config - Answer questions to PSMPS only, no need to open an editor!
	- Using grep/sed ins combo to auto config most wallets, the stratum, and mpos settings with only minimal user input.
	
- psmps-repair-permissions (Resets Ownership/Permissions - EAsY)
- psmps-repair-crontab (checks/adds coinname to crontab - EAsY)
- psmps-repair-startup (checks/adds coinname to startup script - EAsY)
- psmps-repair-configs (repairs symbolic links to csf config, coin configs,stratum configs, and MPOS configs in each coin dir - SUPER EASY :D)

Stratum / MPOS change:
- Allow static assigned git address, or have option to custom git / wget like the wallet install.
