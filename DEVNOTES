	DEV NOTES

	In short, I will optimize tasks so the version will be split to have an update
	later for unimportant scripts. :) The most efficient route to release :D

	Last Update:		14/03/10 - 1432 EST (GMT-0500)
	
	Updated Release Time:	I am not sure anymore :-/ Hopefully no more than tonight.

	NOTE: hammering out some bugs, then just gotta add things to startup and crontab
	      and then we're ready for a quick test :D

FOR v1.01 THE FOLLOWING IS LEFT TO DO

- Stratum Install - WORKING - need testing on my 'virgin' server
- MPOS Install - WORKING - need testing on my 'virgin' server
- Wallet Install - WORKING - need testing on my 'virgin' server -- startup script also needs linking) and need shutdown script or start | restart | stop ability. Run update-rc.d to add script to startup :)


FOR the v1.2 INSTALL and v1.01 - v1.2 UPDATE THE FOLLOWING IS LEFT TO DO

- psmps-repair-permissions (Resets Ownership/Permissions - EAsY)
- psmps-repair-crontab (checks/adds coinname to crontab - EAsY)
- psmps-repair-startup (checks/adds coinname to startup script - EAsY)
- psmps-repair-configs (repairs symbolic links to csf config, coin configs,stratum configs, and MPOS configs in each coin dir - SUPER EASY :D)
- psmps-repair-all-scripts (Run every repair script) - Super Easy :D)

Stratum / MPOS change:
- Allow static assigned git address, or have option to custom git / wget like the wallet install.
