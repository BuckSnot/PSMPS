	DEV NOTES

	In short, I will optimize tasks so the version will be split to have an update
	later for unimportant scripts. :) The most efficient route to release :D

	Last Update:		14/03/09 - 1619 EST (GMT-0500)
	Updated Release Time:	Today some time

	NOTE: Working all night. May not update dev notes as much. 
	      I will be working on this until 1400 tomorrow.
